    <h1>SARAH CYNTHIA SYLVIA STOUT
        WOULD NOT TAKE THE GARBAGE OUT</h1>
    <h2>by Shel Silverstein</h2>
    <p1>Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout
        Would not take the garbage out!
        Sheâ€™d scour the pots and scrape the pans,
        Candy the yams and spice the hams,
        And though her daddy would scream and shout,
        She simply would not take the garbage out.</p1>
        
    <p2>And so it piled up to the ceiling:
        Coffee grounds, potato peelings,
        Brown bananas, rotten peas,
        Chunks of sour cottage cheese</p2>
